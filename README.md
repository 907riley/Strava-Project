# Quantified Self Project
Final project for CPSC 222  
By: Riley Sikes


## Introduction

* This jupyter notebook goes through a project analyzing the relationship between running and the temperature
as well as the genre of music listened to.
* The notebook has several visuals, hypothesis tests, and machine learning algorithms to explore the dataset.

## How to Use
* Make sure you run both the Technical Report file and the utils.py file completely so everything loads correctly.
* The work for my hypothesis tests is shown in the SourceCode_HypothesisTesting.ipynb file.
* There are a couple things that can be interacted with in the notebook
  * The print_songs() function can take in any date that I ran on and print the songs that I listened to
  during that run.
  * The machine learning algorithms can be changed by changing the features that are dropped, the max_depth
  of the decision tree, and the n_neighbors for the kNN classifier.
